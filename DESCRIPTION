Title: Stan Model Adjustments and Sensitivity Analyses using Importance Sampling
Version: 0.1.1

Description: Functions to help assess the sensitivity of a Bayesian model 
    (fitted using the rstan pakcage) to the specification of its likelihood and
    priors. Users provide a series of alternate sampling specifications, and the 
    package uses Pareto-smoothed importance sampling to estimate posterior 
    quantities of interest under each specification.
