Description: Functions to help assess the sensitivity of a Bayesian model 
    (fitted using the rstan pakcage) to the specification of its likelihood and
    priors.Users provide a series of alternate sampling specifications, and the 
    package uses Pareto-smoothed importance sampling to estimate posterior 
    quantities of interest under each specification.
