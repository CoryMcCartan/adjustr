  title: "adjustr: Stan Model Adjustments and Sensitivity Analyses using Importance Sampling"
  description: >
    An R package which provides functions to help assess the sensitivity of a
    Bayesian model to the specification of its likelihood and priors. Users
    provide a series of alternate sampling specifications, and the package uses
    Pareto-smoothed importance sampling to estimate posterior quantities of
    interest under each specification. The package also provides functions to
    summarize and plot how these quantities change across specifications.
